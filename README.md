# Steel Data SQL and Data Visualization Projects

Welcome to my **SQL and Data Visualization Portfolio**!

This repository showcases a range of data analysis and visualization projects using datasets that were originally sourced from the Steel Data learning website (now defunct). These projects highlight my skills in SQL (SQLite), data manipulation, and creating insightful visualizations (PowerBI).

## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates practical experience with:
- Writing complex SQL queries for data analysis
- Cleaning and transforming raw datasets
- Creating visualizations to communicate findings
- Documenting analytical processes and results

## Contents

- **SQL Scripts**: Example queries and analysis workflows
- **Visualization Files**: Charts, dashboards, and visual reports
- **Sample Datasets**: (If included) Data files originally obtained from Steel Data
- **Documentation**: Project notes and explanations
